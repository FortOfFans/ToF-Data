    "description": "Starting log...\r\nLast night, I went to Cetus Island on my lonesome to watch the fireworks. Not only was it spectacular, but the music was also wonderful. That's why I proposed to Mr. Kolador that we should set off fireworks all day long on Artificial Island. However, he rejected the romantic proposal on the grounds that it might blow up the island's barrier.\r\nIf Dr. Claire requires a staff member who's not just a puppet, I'm willing to join her... Never mind, please delete this paragraph. Mr. Kolador was quite right in what he said. That was thoughtless of me, and there's still so much I have to learn from him.",
